✅ 3. List of Core Tools to Orchestrate
These are the skills/tools the AI Agent orchestrates. Each is modular and can be invoked conditionally.

Tool / Skill	Purpose
S3_Doc_Search	Retrieves info from pre-embedded S3 documents via vector search
Webpage_Navigator	Scrapes current page or DOM tree to help users navigate the frontend
Ticket_Creator	Escalates user-reported issues to a ticket system or database
Memory_Manager	Tracks session history, repeated Answers, and user preferences

✅ Yes, all of these are part of the agent’s skill orchestration.

✅ 4. Do You Need Cache?
Yes — use cache to:
Avoid repeated vector DB searches for similar queries

Reduce scraping overhead if same element is queried again

Speed up ticket creation logic or metadata fetching

Recommended Cache Tech:
Purpose	Tool
Response cache (S3/doc/navigator)	Redis, Memcached
Vector similarity cache	In-memory via FAISS
DOM snapshot cache	Local JSON with expiry

✅ 5. Full Architecture with AWS + React + FastAPI

Question

below features are expected :
1.real-time streaming of the AI agent's responses
2.assistant should interact live as the user types (like ChatGPT typing animations)
3.expect long-processing tasks (e.g., ticket creation, navigation scraping)
now including these along with cache ,S3
and using agent and skills as shown in attached image. Describe a workflow showing how user inputs querry and the "user support" answer it ,and follow up queries also.

Answer
Great! You want the User Support AI Agent to:

Stream responses in real time (✅ WebSocket needed)

Respond while the user types (✅ typing animations)

Handle long-latency tasks like scraping or ticket creation (✅ async architecture)

Use a modular skill-based agent setup (✅ as shown in your image)

Use caching and S3-backed vector search (✅ performance and reliability)

✅ High-Level Workflow
Let’s walk through a real-world end-to-end query workflow including follow-ups, using your architecture:

🧠 Step-by-Step Workflow (Real-time AI Support System)
🧩 Components Involved:
Frontend (React + TypeScript + WebSocket)

FastAPI (LLM Orchestrator + Skill Handlers)

Redis (for cache)

S3 + Vector DB (for doc search)

Puppeteer/Playwright (for webpage_navigator)

PostgreSQL / DynamoDB (for ticket storage)

🌐 1. User Types a Query
Ex: "I can't find the billing section on this page."

Frontend:
Opens WebSocket connection

Sends partial + full query to backend for real-time response streaming

Also sends exposed DOM tree (if available via useDOMMetadata() hook)

🧠 2. FastAPI Receives Query
Backend: LLM Orchestrator
Analyzes intent: Is this a doc retrieval, DOM issue, or a ticket-worthy problem?

Dispatches to appropriate Skill Module (based on tool description logic or LangChain Agent)

🔧 3. Skill Modules Kick In
Possible Skill Routing:
Detected Intent	Skill Triggered	Action
User asked about UI element	webpage_navigator	Reads DOM structure or triggers page scraping (async Playwright)
User referred to billing docs	doc_searcher	Vector search over S3-embedded docs
User reports a bug	ticket_creator	Stores issue in DB or 3rd party (like Zendesk)

✅ All skills are async tasks, allowing streaming while the agent waits.

🔄 4. Real-time Response Streaming
Backend:
Starts streaming an initial placeholder (e.g., “Let me look that up…”)

As skill response is ready:

Streams result back line by line

Ends with recommended actions or follow-up buttons (like "Create Ticket", "Go to Billing Page")

💡 5. Utility Modules Enhance Quality
response_formatter: Adds friendliness, tone, clarity

cache_layer: Checks Redis cache for similar queries / elements

memory_manager: Saves Answer & response for follow-up continuity

🔁 6. Follow-up Query Handling
Example Follow-up:
"Actually, it's showing error code 500 when I click it."

memory_manager recognizes it's related to last DOM interaction

Triggers:

Re-run of webpage_navigator for click events (simulate via Playwright)

If issue confirmed, invokes ticket_creator

Final response: “That’s likely a backend error. I’ve created a ticket for our engineers — here’s your reference: #TIC-2193.”

📂 Cached Elements & Sessions:
Similar queries within 30 min pull from Redis

Partial DOM trees for page reused for navigation follow-ups

Vector DB embeddings refreshed daily or on doc upload

🧪 Example Use Case
👩 User: "I’m trying to update my billing address, but there’s no update button."

LLM detects this is UI-based → invokes webpage_navigator

Finds element is hidden due to disabled feature

Formats response: “Looks like the update feature is disabled on this page. Want me to raise a ticket?”

👩 User: "Yes, please."

ticket_creator invoked → streams response: “Ticket #1457 created. Our team will fix it shortly.”

Would you like this entire architecture scaffolded in code (especially the FastAPI + WebSocket streaming + agent orchestrator)?







Question
FastAPI (LLM Orchestrator + Skill Handlers) this will be done by agent right ?
what all task above going to be addresed by agent and how ?


Answer
Excellent follow-up. Yes — the “agent” is the core intelligence that orchestrates decision-making and task delegation within your FastAPI backend.

Let’s clarify exactly what the agent does, what FastAPI handles, and how your architecture connects everything.

🧠 𝗪𝗵𝗼/𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝗶𝘀 𝘁𝗵𝗲 “𝗔𝗴𝗲𝗻𝘁”?
The LLM Agent (or "Agent Brain") is:

A language-model-driven decision engine (e.g., LangChain Agent, Semantic Kernel Planner, or custom LLM function-caller)

It does not run your web server, but lives inside your FastAPI backend

Think of it as the brain inside the FastAPI skull

✅ Tasks That the “Agent” Handles
Agent Responsibilities (pure logic):
Feature/Task	Agent Role
Query Parsing & Intent Detection	Understands user query and figures out what tool/skill to use
Tool/Skill Selection	Calls the appropriate tool (doc_searcher, webpage_navigator, etc.)
Tool Input Formatting	Converts user input into required format for the tool
Response Interpretation	Post-processes raw tool output into something the user can understand
Response Stitching	Merges answers, streaming them line-by-line
Memory Management	Uses memory_manager to load/store relevant session context
Follow-up Handling	Tracks context for user’s next Answer and adapts response
Fallback Logic	Chooses retry strategies or fallback tools if a skill fails

🔁 The Agent doesn’t fetch data itself — it decides who should.

🖥️ Tasks Handled by FastAPI (Server)
Feature/Task	FastAPI Role
WebSocket Setup	Manages socket connection for real-time query/response
API Routing	Listens for /ask, /vector-search, /ticket, /page-info, etc.
Concurrency Management	Async I/O for tasks like scraping, S3 access, DB writes
Skill Hosting	Hosts tool interfaces as separate classes/modules: DocSearcher, Navigator
Streaming Response to Frontend	Streams response via yield/await over WebSocket
Interacting with Redis/S3/DBs	Performs actual GET/POST to services like Redis, S3, Dynamo, Postgres

🔄 Agent-Skill Communication Flow (Inside FastAPI)
pgsql
Copy
Edit
User (via WebSocket)
  → FastAPI receives request
    → Calls Agent (with context, history, prompt)
      → Agent chooses: call_doc_searcher()
        → FastAPI invokes DocSearcher skill
            → Pulls vector from Redis/S3
            → Sends output back to Agent
      → Agent formats a response
    → FastAPI streams response back to frontend
🧠 Agent Use Case Breakdown:
📄 Use Case: “Where can I download my invoice?”
Agent detects: “DocSearch” skill is best

Formats query for embedding search

Calls doc_searcher skill with prompt

Receives top-3 results with metadata

Chooses best snippet and explains to user

Streams response: “You can download invoices from the Billing Portal…”

🌐 Use Case: “This page is not loading my details”
Agent checks memory → user on Account Page

Calls webpage_navigator with DOM or triggers scraping

Agent receives DOM tree, finds issue in JS component

Rephrases output for user and optionally triggers ticket_creator

Streams friendly summary + action: “Seems like a bug, want me to raise a ticket?”

🧠 TL;DR Summary
Layer	Role
Agent	Smart brain: parses, plans, selects tools, formats answers
Skills	Tools like DocSearcher, Navigator, TicketBot — they do the "work"
FastAPI	Infrastructure: hosts agent + skills, serves WebSocket, manages async
Frontend	Sends input, renders live typing, maintains session


Question
lets create a architecture based on above detailed response.


Answer
Great! Let’s build a modular, real-time, LLM Agent-powered support system architecture based on your:

🔧 Tools/skills (doc_searcher, webpage_navigator, ticket_creator, etc.)

⚙️ Backend (FastAPI)

💬 Frontend (React + TypeScript)

☁️ AWS infrastructure

⚡ Features like streaming, long tasks, memory, caching, S3, and follow-up handling

🧱 ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW
We'll structure this into 4 clear layers:

🖼️ 1. Frontend Layer (React + TypeScript)
Component	Description
Chat UI	Text input, typing animation, chat bubbles, "live typing" UX
WebSocket Client	Connects to FastAPI /ws/chat, streams responses token-by-token
Streaming Renderer	Renders LLM outputs in real time as they come
Session Tracker	Maintains session ID, context history, user state
Feedback/Actions	Shows buttons for "Create Ticket", "Summarize", etc.

⚙️ 2. Backend Layer (FastAPI + Orchestrator)
🚦 Primary Endpoints
POST /ask – fallback REST for test/debug

GET /ws/chat – WebSocket endpoint for real-time streaming

POST /upload – Upload files to S3

POST /vector-search – Embedding search via doc_searcher

🎛️ Core Components
Module	Role
LLM Agent	Core planner – decides which skill to trigger
Tool Interfaces	doc_searcher, webpage_navigator, ticket_creator, etc.
Cache Layer	Redis to store embeddings, session data, temp responses
Memory Manager	Tracks user’s preferences, context, session-level memory
Response Formatter	Converts skill outputs to human-readable text
Task Queue (Optional)	Celery/async job pool for long tasks like webpage scraping

🤖 3. Skills Layer (Pluggable Tools)
Skill	Input From Agent	Output to Agent
doc_searcher	Query string → embedding + similarity	Relevant docs/snippets
webpage_navigator	URL + Selector or heuristic	JSON DOM, screenshot, error message
ticket_creator	Issue description	Ticket ID, status
memory_manager	Session ID	User context/history
cache_layer	Key:value caching for reruns	Quick lookup of recent answers

☁️ 4. AWS Infrastructure Layer
AWS Service	Role
S3	Stores uploaded documents, screenshots, scrape results
DynamoDB/Postgres	Stores memory, session history, tickets
Redis (ElastiCache)	Fast in-memory cache (e.g., for embeddings, query results)
CloudFront + S3	Frontend hosting (if static deploy)
API Gateway + Lambda (Optional)	If scaling/microservice model is needed
Bedrock/OpenAI	LLM inference (chat completion, embeddings, tool parsing)

🧭 END-TO-END WORKFLOW
Here’s how a full user interaction flows:

✍️ User asks a query:
“Why is my profile page broken?”

✅ Step-by-step Processing:
Frontend (React)

User types → request sent via WebSocket to /ws/chat

Typing animation kicks in

Shows “Assistant is thinking…”

Backend (FastAPI)

Receives message → forwards to Agent

Agent checks memory (e.g., last known page = /profile)

Determines tool: webpage_navigator

Navigator Skill

Invoked with target URL (e.g., /profile) and rules

Uses Playwright to scrape DOM or parse exposed JSON

Returns structured info (errors, missing elements)

Agent

Formats insight from navigator

Optionally triggers ticket_creator if issue found

Uses response_formatter to phrase message

Cache Layer (Redis)

Caches final answer by hash of query for next time

Saves DOM result for 5 min in case of follow-up

Memory Manager

Updates session state (e.g., “User had issue with profile page”)

Streaming

Agent sends partial response chunks via FastAPI WebSocket

Frontend renders live as agent types

Question
cache layer shall be part of Frontend right ? the Redis 


Answer
Great Answer — here's how it typically works:

❓ Should the cache layer (e.g., Redis) be part of the frontend?
No, the cache layer (like Redis or Memcached) is not part of the frontend. It should reside in the backend infrastructure.

✅ Where Redis Belongs in Your Architecture:
Redis should be part of your backend layer, typically accessed by:

FastAPI (Agent Orchestrator) for:

Caching user queries

Caching responses

Caching document embeddings

Caching page navigation results

LLM Agent or tools that process repeated user inputs

💡 Why Redis Shouldn't Be on Frontend:
Frontend (React + TypeScript) runs on the browser and:

Cannot connect directly to Redis (it’s a server-side service)

Cannot securely store or handle Redis credentials

Should only send user inputs via API calls to the backend

🏗️ Correct Setup:
Frontend (React)
→ Sends user query via WebSocket/HTTP to FastAPI

Backend (FastAPI / Agent Orchestrator)
→ Checks Redis cache first
→ If cache miss, calls the appropriate Skill
→ Caches the response in Redis
→ Streams the answer back to frontend

If you'd like, I can update the previous architecture diagram to show Redis clearly in the backend caching layer.







Question
POST /upload – Upload files to S3
will not be needed since this document will be beforehand manually stored in S3 ,to be used as information source.


Answer
You're absolutely right.

Since the document is already manually stored in S3 and used solely as a reference for the doc_searcher skill (via embeddings in a Vector DB), the POST /upload endpoint is not required in this architecture.

✅ What You’ll Need Instead:
1. At Setup Time (One-Time/Offline Process):
Manually upload the document to S3.

Run an embedding pipeline:

Load the document from S3.

Chunk and embed the text.

Store embeddings into a Vector DB (e.g., Pinecone, Weaviate, FAISS, etc.).

2. At Runtime (User Query Time):
The doc_searcher skill:

Accepts user input.

Queries the Vector DB using similarity search.

Retrieves relevant chunks.

Sends them to the LLM for context-aware answering.

🔄 Summary of Required Data Flow:
No: POST /upload

Yes: Background process to embed documents

Yes: doc_searcher skill reads from Vector DB (not directly from S3)

Yes: S3 is a static storage layer, not involved during user interaction

Let me know if you'd like the updated architecture diagram without POST /upload!
